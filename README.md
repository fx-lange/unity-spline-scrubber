# Spline Scrubber

Timeline integration for splines.

## What?

Want your objects to follow a spline, driven by timeline? 

Try **Spline Scrubber**

## Work in progress

Unity is about to release a new spline tool (part of 2022.1). 

In the meantime Spline Scrubber offers an abstract base class to allow integrations with different spline solutions.
But this will be deprecated in favor of a better integration with `com.unity.splines.`

In production we are using cinemachine dolly tracks and you can find the implementation in the cinemachine branch.
